   - **Tools Used:** Scrapy crawlers for efficient and scalable web scraping.
   - **Outcome:** Cleaned and structured datasets ready for analysis.

2. **Character Chatbot**
   - **Goal:** Simulate conversations with Naruto using a fine-tuned Llama LLM (8B).
   - **Tools Used:** Llama LLM, Hugging Face Transformers.
   - **Outcome:** An interactive chatbot providing an immersive character interaction experience.

3. **Character Network Visualization**
   - **Goal:** Visualize character interactions and communication strength.
   - **Tools Used:** SpaCy NER, NetworkX, PyViz.
   - **Outcome:** A graph network revealing interaction patterns among characters.

4. **Theme and Text Classifiers**
   - **Theme Classifier:** Users input themes like "love" or "friendship" to visualize their prevalence in the series.
   - **Text Classifier:** Classify fight scenes based on provided descriptions.
   - **Tools Used:** Hugging Face Zero-Shot Classifier, Custom LLM Text Classifier.
   - **Outcome:** Bar plots of theme prevalence and fight scene classifications.

5. **Interactive Web GUI**
